## Moderation Workflow

### Standard Review Process
1. Photo submitted â†’ status: pending
2. Admin reviews photo and metadata
3. Decision: approve, reject, or flag for further review
4. User notified of decision
5. If rejected: reason provided, re-submission allowed

### Report Handling Process
1. User reports photo with reason
2. Photo flagged for admin review
3. Admin investigates report
4. Action taken: dismiss report, reject photo, or escalate
5. Reporter and photo owner notified
6. Photo status updated accordingly

### Bulk Moderation
- Select multiple photos for batch actions
- Apply same action to multiple items
- Bulk rejection with common reasons
- Progress tracking for large batches
- Undo functionality for recent actions
