### Sidebar Navigation Structure
```typescript
// Updated navigation hierarchy:
{
  label: "Competition Management",
  items: [
    {
      label: "All Competitions",
      href: "/admin/competitions",
      icon: Trophy
    },
    {
      label: "Create Competition", 
      href: "/admin/competitions/new",
      icon: Plus
    },
    // Dynamic items when viewing specific competition:
    {
      label: "Competition Details",
      href: "/admin/competitions/[id]",
      icon: Info
    },
    {
      label: "Manage Categories",
      href: "/admin/competitions/[id]/categories", 
      icon: Tag
    }
  ]
}
```

### Breadcrumb Patterns
```typescript
// Breadcrumb patterns to implement:
/admin/competitions
→ Admin / Competitions

/admin/competitions/new  
→ Admin / Competitions / New Competition

/admin/competitions/[id]
→ Admin / Competitions / [Competition Title]

/admin/competitions/[id]/edit
→ Admin / Competitions / [Competition Title] / Edit

/admin/competitions/[id]/categories
→ Admin / Competitions / [Competition Title] / Categories
```

### Route Structure
```typescript
// Complete route hierarchy:
_auth.admin.competitions._index.tsx          // Competition list
_auth.admin.competitions.new.tsx             // Create competition
_auth.admin.competitions.$id._index.tsx      // Competition detail
_auth.admin.competitions.$id.edit.tsx        // Edit competition
_auth.admin.competitions.$id.categories.tsx  // Manage categories
```

## Deep Linking Support

### URL Patterns
```typescript

/admin/competitions                           // List all
/admin/competitions?status=active             // Filter by status  
/admin/competitions?search=summer             // Search competitions
/admin/competitions/new                       // Create new
/admin/competitions/abc-123                   // View specific
/admin/competitions/abc-123/edit              // Edit specific

```
