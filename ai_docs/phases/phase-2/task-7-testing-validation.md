# Task 7: Testing & Validation

## Overview
Comprehensive testing and validation of all competition management features to ensure reliability, usability, and compliance with business rules. This includes functional testing, edge case validation, and quality assurance.

## Goals
- Test all CRUD operations end-to-end
- Verify business rule enforcement
- Validate form handling and edge cases
- Ensure responsive design works across devices
- Run comprehensive quality checks

## Testing Areas

### Functional Testing

#### Competition CRUD Operations
```typescript
// Test scenarios:
✓ Create competition with valid data
✓ Create competition with invalid data (validation errors)
✓ Edit existing competition successfully
✓ Delete competition (with confirmation)
✓ Activate competition (enforcing single active rule)
✓ Deactivate competition
✓ List competitions with filters
✓ Search competitions by title
✓ Pagination functionality
```

#### Category Management
```typescript
// Test scenarios:
✓ Create category with valid name and limits
✓ Create category with duplicate name (should fail)
✓ Edit category name and photo limits
✓ Delete empty category
✓ Attempt to delete category with photos (should prevent)
✓ Bulk category operations
✓ Default category creation on new competition
```

#### Business Rule Validation
```typescript
// Critical business rules to test:
✓ Only one active competition allowed
✓ Cannot activate competition when another is active
✓ End date must be after start date
✓ Cannot delete competition with submissions
✓ Category names must be unique per competition
✓ Photo limits must be between 1-20
✓ Title and description length validation
```

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

#### Date Validation
- Start date in the past for new competitions
- End date before start date
- Very distant future dates
- Leap year date handling
- Timezone edge cases
- Invalid date formats

#### Form Validation
- Extremely long titles/descriptions
- Special characters in titles
- Empty required fields
- Network interruption during submission
- Concurrent edits by multiple admins
- Browser back/forward during form submission

#### Data Integrity
- Competition not found (404 handling)
- User permission changes during session
- Database connection issues
- Malformed API responses
- Race conditions in status changes

### User Interface Testing

#### Responsive Design
```typescript
// Test on multiple screen sizes:
- Mobile (320px - 768px)
- Tablet (768px - 1024px)  
- Desktop (1024px+)
- Ultra-wide displays (1440px+)

// Key areas to verify:
✓ Competition list table/cards responsive
✓ Forms work well on mobile
✓ Navigation remains usable
✓ Modals/dialogs fit screen properly
✓ Touch targets are adequate size
```

#### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

#### Accessibility Testing
```typescript
// Accessibility checklist:
✓ Keyboard navigation works throughout
✓ Screen reader announces content properly
✓ Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
✓ Focus indicators are visible
✓ Form labels are properly associated
✓ Error messages are announced
✓ Modal focus trapping works
✓ Skip links function correctly
```

### Performance Testing

#### Load Performance
- Page load times under 3 seconds
- Form submission response times
- Large competition list rendering
- Image/asset optimization
- Bundle size impact

#### User Experience
- Smooth animations and transitions
- No layout shift during loading
- Proper loading states
- Optimistic updates work correctly
- Error recovery is seamless

### Integration Testing

#### tRPC Integration
```typescript
// API integration tests:
✓ All competition procedures work
✓ All category procedures work  
✓ Error responses are handled properly
✓ Loading states are managed
✓ Optimistic updates work correctly
✓ Cache invalidation functions properly
```

#### Dashboard Integration
- Competition statistics update correctly
- Links between dashboard and management pages work
- Data consistency across pages
- Real-time updates where applicable

## Testing Tools & Process

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Commands to run:
bun check                    # Type checking and linting
bun test                     # Unit tests (if implemented)
bun build                    # Production build test
```

### Manual Testing Protocol
1. **Fresh Installation Test**
   - Start with clean database
   - Test complete user journey
   - Verify default data creation

2. **Regression Testing**
   - Test existing functionality still works
   - Verify dashboard integration intact
   - Check authentication still functions

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Test critical paths in each browser
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Check for browser-specific issues

### Bug Tracking
- Document all issues found
- Categorize by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Track resolution status
- Verify fixes don't break other features

## Performance Benchmarks
- Competition list with 100+ items loads in <2s
- Form submission completes in <1s
- Page transitions feel instant (<300ms)
- Mobile performance is comparable to desktop

## Success Criteria
