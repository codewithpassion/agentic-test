describe('Photo Submission Flow', () => {
  test('should validate file types correctly')
  test('should enforce submission limits')
  test('should save metadata properly')
  test('should handle upload failures gracefully')
})
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
// tests/upload-integration.test.ts
describe('R2 Upload Integration', () => {
  test('should generate valid signed URLs')
  test('should upload files to R2 successfully')
  test('should confirm uploads properly')
  test('should clean up failed uploads')
})
```

### E2E Tests
```typescript
// tests/e2e/submission-flow.test.ts
describe('Complete Submission Flow', () => {
  test('user can submit photo end-to-end')
  test('admin can view submissions')
  test('public gallery displays approved photos')
})
```
