### Accessibility Implementation

#### Screen Reader Support
```typescript
// Semantic HTML structure
<main role="main" aria-label="Photo gallery">
  <section aria-labelledby="competition-title">
    <h2 id="competition-title">Wildlife Photography 2024</h2>
    <div role="grid" aria-label="Photo submissions">
      {photos.map(photo => (
        <article role="gridcell" aria-labelledby={`photo-${photo.id}`}>
          <img 
            src={photo.url} 
            alt={photo.description}
            aria-describedby={`meta-${photo.id}`}
          />
          <h3 id={`photo-${photo.id}`}>{photo.title}</h3>
          <p id={`meta-${photo.id}`}>
            By {photo.photographer} â€¢ {photo.votes} votes
          </p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  </section>
