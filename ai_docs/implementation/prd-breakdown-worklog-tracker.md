## Prioritization Recommendation

### Week 1: Data Foundation
**Focus**: Establish database schema and seed data
- US-009: Establish worklog data structure (Critical - must complete first)

### Week 2-3: Core Employee Features
**Focus**: Enable individual time tracking
- US-001: Log work hours (High priority, enables all other features)
- US-002: View personal worklogs (High priority, core user value)
- US-003: Filter worklogs (Medium priority, enhances usability)
- US-004: Edit/delete entries (Medium priority, necessary for error correction)

### Week 3-4: Admin Oversight
**Focus**: Enable organizational management
- US-007: View user list (Medium priority, foundation for admin features)
- US-006: Manage user hours (High priority, key admin capability)
- US-005: View all worklogs (High priority, key oversight capability)

### Week 4+: Polish & Public Access
**Focus**: Complete public-facing features
- US-008: Help page (Low priority, nice-to-have for launch)

## Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Path
```
US-009 (Data Foundation)
  ├─→ US-001 (Log hours) ──→ US-002 (View list) ──→ US-003 (Filter)
  │                                    └──→ US-004 (Edit/Delete)
  ├─→ US-007 (User list) ──→ US-006 (Manage hours)
  └─→ US-005 (Admin view all)

US-008 (Help page) - Independent
```

### Key Dependencies
- **US-009 must complete first**: All other stories depend on database schema
- **US-001 before US-002**: Need creation working before viewing
- **US-002 before US-003/004**: Filtering and editing require list view
- **US-007 before US-006**: User management requires user list

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Performance with Large Datasets**
- **Concern**: 10K users × 10 years of data could slow queries
- **Mitigation**: Efficient indexes created in US-009 (`by_user_date`, `by_date_user`)
- **Validation**: Performance testing in US-009 (target: < 500ms queries)

**Risk 2: OT/UT Calculation Complexity**
- **Concern**: Grouping entries by day and calculating totals could be error-prone
- **Mitigation**: Clear business rules documented in each story
- **Validation**: Comprehensive test checklists for OT/UT scenarios

**Risk 3: Authorization Gaps**
- **Concern**: Users accessing/modifying others' worklogs
- **Mitigation**: Server-side authorization enforced in all Convex functions
- **Validation**: Authorization test cases in each story

**Risk 4: TypeScript Strict Mode**
- **Concern**: PRD emphasizes NO `any` types, could slow development
- **Mitigation**: Architecture already uses strict TypeScript, team familiar
- **Validation**: `bun check` must pass for Definition of Done

## Architectural Considerations

### Database Design
- **Convex real-time database** with typed schema
- **Compound indexes** for efficient queries:
  - `by_user_date` for user-specific queries
  - `by_date_user` for admin cross-user queries
  - `by_user_createdAt` for chronological sorting
- **Date format**: "YYYY-MM-DD" strings for easy comparison

### Real-Time Features
- All queries use Convex `useQuery` (auto-subscribes to changes)
- UI updates automatically when data changes
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance

### Authorization Model
- **Client-side**: Route guards and UI hiding (UX)
- **Server-side**: Convex function validation (security boundary)
- **Roles**: User (default), Admin (oversight + management)

### Performance Characteristics
- **Target**: < 500ms for all queries
- **Pagination**: 10 days (user), 20 days (admin)
- **Filtering**: Server-side to reduce data transfer
- **Scalability**: Indexes support 10K+ users efficiently
