# üîÑ Transform Todo App to Generic Boilerplate

**Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Check

This command transforms the Todo application into a clean, generic application with the name passed in the arguments by removing all Todo-specific functionality while preserving the authentication, admin system, and service architecture.

**To proceed, you must pass "confirm" as an argument and a new name for the app:**

```
/transform-to-boilerplate confirm calender-booker
```

**If you pass any other argument or no argument, this command will only show documentation.**

## What This Does

### üóëÔ∏è Removes:

- `todos` database table and migrations
- `TodosService` class
- `/api/todos` API routes
- `/todos` frontend route
- Todo React components (`app/components/features/todos/`)
- Todo hooks and API types
- Todo navigation links and UI references
- Todo-specific permissions

### ‚úÖ Preserves:

- Clerk authentication system
- User management and admin panel
- Role-based permissions (cleaned)
- Database patterns and service examples
- All UI infrastructure
- Build/deployment config

### üîÉ Udates:

- package.json name
- wrangler.jsonc name
- 'Todo App' name in the footer, admin-header, navigation elements, admin dashboard, \_index.tsx router, unauthorized.tsx

## üöÄ Execution (Only if confirmed)

I will automatically execute all transformation steps if you confirmed with "confirm". Otherwise, I'll stop here and only show this documentation.

**Your argument was:** `$ARGUMENTS`
